# Let's talk about Abdullah [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.com/iabduul7/iabduul7.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.com/iabduul7/iabduul7)

As someone who is always passionate for learning more about new technologies and experiencing old ones. Abdullah grew up developing python scripts, responsive android applications and ever since he's a self taught app developer. From those humble beginnings, he has evolved into a Mobile Application Developer who loves working with cutting edge tools and technologies, experimenting design×development×data integrations and keen to share his experience with people around the world. He, like any developer who has burnt the midnight oil, knows how to make a mean cup of coffee ☕️ but he loves having a cup of tea more than coffee!

- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; **Working from Home now-a-days**.
- 💬 &nbsp; People ask him about `React Native, Kotlin, JavaScript, Java, Firebase, Python`.
- 📖 &nbsp; Learning about `Flutter, Laravel`
